# docker-customer-chroot

## About

Docker image based on debian-slim that can be used as a containerized environment
to give customers restricted ssh access to their environment.

## Packages

Some system packages from passwd, base-passwd, adduser, login and mount are removed, these
are not needed. Since they use setuid it is safer to remove them.

Installed packages:

- php-cli and most php extensions (for php 5.6, 7.0, 7.1 and 7.2)
- nano
- vim
- vim-addon-manager 
- git
- rsync
- mariadb-client
- socat
- wget
- curl
- patch
- less
- ssh-client
- ca-certificates
- bzip2
- file
- xz-utils
- zip
- unzip

## usage

Needs additional setup. Very simplified:

- launch an instance of this container on user ssh login (e.g. with pam exec)
- bind mount (docker -v) directories the user can use
- give the user a custom shell that uses "docker exec" to run command in this use container
